    I have already started messing with the default "War Games" theme and it's a work-in-progress!

    Using the classic "Hacker" film as my theme.

## Todo List:

- Desktop Layout
  - Icon Creation
  - Changing the Code ( **Json files** )

- Set all Screens
  - Alerts
    - Backgrounds
    - Tones
    - Messages
  - Payloads
  - PineAP
  - Recon
    - Make Dark
    - Use Black and Red colour scheme
  - Settings


## Document as I go!

    Need to keep a record of how and why I made the changes.
